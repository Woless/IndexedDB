Title: Indexed Database API (Second Edition)
Shortname: IndexedDB
Abstract: This document defines APIs for a database of records holding
    simple values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key
    and some value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records
    it stores. An application developer directly uses an API to locate
    records either by their key or by using an index. A query language can
    be layered on this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a
    persistent B-tree data structure.

<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

User agents need to store large numbers of objects locally in order to
satisfy off-line data requirements of Web applications. [[WEBSTORAGE]]
is useful for storing pairs of keys and their corresponding values.
However, it does not provide in-order retrieval of keys, efficient
searching over values, or storage of duplicate values for a key.

This specification provides a concrete API to perform advanced
key-value data management that is at the heart of most sophisticated
query processors. It does so by using transactional databases to store
keys and their corresponding values (one or more per key), and
providing a means of traversing keys in a deterministic order. This is
often implemented through the use of persistent B-tree data structures
that are considered efficient for insertion and deletion as well as
in-order traversal of very large numbers of data records.


<aside class=example>
In the following example, the API is used to access a "library"
database that holds books stored by their "isbn" attribute.
Additionally, an index is maintained on the "title" attribute of the
objects stored in the object store. This index can be used to look up
books by title, and enforces a uniqueness constraint. Another index is
maintained on the "author" attribute of the objects, and can be used
to look up books by author.

A connection to the database is opened. If the "library" database did
not already exist, it is created and an event handler creates the
object store and indexes. Finally, the opened connection is saved for
use in subsequent examples.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var request = indexedDB.open("library");

request.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // The database did not previously exist, so create object stores and indexes.
  var db = request.result;
  var store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
  var titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
  var authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");

  // Populate with initial data.
  store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
  store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
  store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result;
};
</pre>

The following example populates the database using a transaction.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");

store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});

tx.oncomplete = function() {
  // All requests have succeeded and the transaction has committed.
};
</pre>

The following example looks up a single book in the database by title
using an index.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var index = store.index("by_title");

var request = index.get("Bedrock Nights");
request.onsuccess = function() {
  var matching = request.result;
  if (matching !== undefined) {
    // A match was found.
    report(matching.isbn, matching.title, matching.author);
  } else {
    // No match was found.
    report(null);
  }
};
</pre>

The following example looks up all books in the database by author
using an index and a cursor.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var index = store.index("by_author");

var request = index.openCursor(IDBKeyRange.only("Fred"));
request.onsuccess = function() {
  var cursor = request.result;
  if (cursor) {
    // Called for each matching record.
    report(cursor.value.isbn, cursor.value.title, cursor.value.author);
    cursor.continue();
  } else {
    // No more matching records.
    report(null);
  }
};
</pre>

The following example shows how errors could be handled when a request
fails.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var request = store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Slate", isbn: 987654});
request.onerror = function() {
  // The uniqueness constraint of the "by_title" index failed.
  report(request.error);
  // Could call request.preventDefault() to prevent the transaction from aborting.
};
tx.onabort = function() {
  // Otherwise the transaction will automatically abort due the failed request.
  report(tx.error);
};
</pre>

The database connection may be closed when it is no longer needed.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
db.close();
</pre>

In the future, the database may have grown to contain other object
stores and indexes. The following example shows one way to handle
opening an older version of the database.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var request = indexedDB.open("library", 3); // Request version 3.

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  var db = request.result;
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 1) {
    // Version 1 is the first version of the database.
    var store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
    var titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
    var authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 2) {
    // Version 2 introduces a new index of books by year.
    var bookStore = request.transaction.objectStore("books");
    var yearIndex = bookStore.createIndex("by_year", "year");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 3) {
    // Version 3 introduces a new object store for magazines with two indexes.
    var magazines = db.createObjectStore("magazines");
    var publisherIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_publisher", "publisher");
    var frequencyIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_frequency", "frequency");
  }
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result; // db.version will be 3.
};
</pre>

A <dfn>sorted list</dfn> is a {{DOMStringList}} containing strings
sorted in ascending order using the algorithm defined by step 4 of
<cite>section 11.8.5, The Abstract Relational Comparison
Algorithm</cite> of the ECMAScript Language Specification
[[!ECMA-262]].

<aside class=issue>Make this reference more robust.</aside>

<h3 id=database-construct>Database</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A database's <a>origin</a> is the same as the <a>origin</a> of the
<a>document</a> or <a>worker</a>. Each <a>origin</a> has an associated
set of databases.

<aside class=note>
  The database origin is not affected by changes to
  the {{Document}}'s {{Document/domain}}.
</aside>

Each <a>origin</a> has an associated set of <a>databases</a>. A
<dfn>database</dfn> has zero or more <a for=/>object stores</a> which hold
the data stored in the database.

<div dfn-for=database>

A <a>database</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn> which identifies it within a
specific <a>origin</a>. The name can be any string value, including
the empty string, and stays constant for the lifetime of the database.
Database names are always compared in a case-sensitive manner, as
opaque sequences of 16-bit code units. Implementations MUST support
all names.

<aside class=note>
  If an implementation uses a storage mechanism which can't handle
  arbitrary database names, the implementation must use an escaping
  mechanism or something similar to map the provided name to a name that
  it can handle.
</aside>

A <a>database</a> has a <dfn>version</dfn>. When a database is first
created, its <a for=database>version</a> is 0 (zero).

<aside class=note>
  Each <a>database</a> has one version at a time; a <a>database</a>
  can't exist in multiple versions at once. The only way to change the
  version is using an <a>upgrade transaction</a>.
</aside>

A database has a <dfn>delete pending flag</dfn> which is used during
deletion. When a database is requested to be deleted the flag is set
and all attempts at opening the database are stalled until the
database can be deleted.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h4 id=database-connection>Database Connection</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with <a>databases</a> directly. Instead,
script has indirect access via a <dfn lt="connection|connected">connection</dfn>.

A <a for=/>connection</a> object can be used to manipulate the objects of
that <a>database</a>. It is also the only way to obtain a
<a for=/>transaction</a> for that <a>database</a>.

The act of opening a <a>database</a> creates a <a for=/>connection</a>.
There MAY be multiple <a for=/>connections</a> to a given <a>database</a> at
any given time.

<div dfn-for=connection>

A <a for=/>connection</a> has a <dfn>version</dfn>, which is set when the
<a for=/>connection</a> is created. It remains constant for the lifetime of
the <a for=/>connection</a> unless an <a data-lt="steps for aborting an
upgrade transaction">upgrade is aborted</a>, in which case it is set
to the previous version of the <a>database</a>. Once the
<a for=/>connection</a> is closed the <a for=connection>version</a> does not change.

Each connection has a <dfn>close pending flag</dfn> which is initially
unset.

When a <a for=/>connection</a> is initially created it is in
<dfn>opened</dfn> state. The connection can be <dfn>closed</dfn>
through several means. If the execution context where the
<a for=/>connection</a> was created is destroyed (for example due to the
user navigating away from that page), the connection is closed. The
connection can also be closed explicitly using the <a>steps for
closing a database connection</a>. When the connection is closed the
<a>close pending flag</a> is always set if it hasn't already been.

A <a for=/>connection</a> may be closed by a user agent in exceptional
circumstances, for example due to loss of access to the file system or
a permission change. If this occurs the user agent MUST run the
<a>steps for closing a database connection</a> with the
<a for=/>connection</a> and with the |forced flag| set.

A <a for=/>connection</a> has an <dfn>object store set</dfn>, which is
initialized to the set of <a for=/>object stores</a> in the associated
<a>database</a> when the <a for=/>connection</a> is created. The
contents of the set will remain constant except when an <a>upgrade
transaction</a> is running.

A <a for=/>connection</a>'s <a>get the parent</a> algorithm returns null.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=object-store-construct>Object Store</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>object store</dfn> is the primary
storage mechanism for storing data in a <a>database</a>.

<div dfn-for=object-store>

Each database has a set of <a for=/>object stores</a>. The set of <a for=/>object
stores</a> can be changed, but only using an <a>upgrade
transaction</a>, i.e. in response to an <a>upgradeneeded</a> event.
When a new database is created it doesn't contain any <a for=/>object
stores</a>.

An <a for=/>object store</a> has a <dfn>list of records</dfn> which hold the
data stored in the object store. Each <dfn>record</dfn> consists of a
<a for=/>key</a> and a <a for=/>value</a>. The list is sorted according to key in
ascending order. There can never be multiple records in a given object
store with the same key.

An <a for=/>object store</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn>. The name can be any string
value, including the empty string. At any one time, the name is unique
within the <a>database</a> to which it belongs. Object store names are
always compared in a case-sensitive manner, as opaque sequences of
16-bit code units.

An <a for=/>object store</a> optionally has a <dfn>key path</dfn>. If the
object store has a key path it is said to use <dfn>in-line keys</dfn>.
Otherwise it is said to use <dfn>out-of-line keys</dfn>.

An <a for=/>object store</a> optionally has a <a>key generator</a>.

An object store can derive a <a for=/>key</a> for a <a>record</a> from one of three sources:

1. A <a>key generator</a>. A key generator generates a monotonically
    increasing numbers every time a key is needed.

2. Keys can be derived via a <a for=object-store>key path</a>.

3. Keys can also be explicitly specified when a <a for=/>value</a> is stored
    in the object store.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h4 id=object-store-handle-construct>Object Store Handle</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with <a for=/>object stores</a> directly. Instead,
within a <a for=/>transaction</a>, script has indirect access via an
<dfn>object store handle</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=object-store-handle>

An <a for=/>object store handle</a> has an associated <dfn>object
store</dfn> and an associated <dfn>transaction</dfn>. Multiple handles
MAY be associated with the same <a for=/>object store</a> in different
<a for=/>transactions</a>, but there MUST be only one <a for=/>object
store handle</a> associated with a particular <a for=/>object
store</a> within a <a for=/>transaction</a>.

An <a for=/>object store handle</a> has an <dfn>index set</dfn>, which
is initialized to the set of <a for=/>indexes</a> that reference the
associated <a for=object-store-handle>object store</a> when the <a
for=/>object store handle</a> is created. The contents of the set will
remain constant except when an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is running.

An <a for=/>object store handle</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is
initialized to the <a for=object-store>name</a> of the associated <a
for=object-store-handle>object store</a> when the <a for=/>object
store handle</a> is created. The name will remain constant except when
an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is running.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=value-construct>Values</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each record is associated with a <dfn>value</dfn>.
User agents MUST support any ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]] value supported
by the <a>structured clone algorithm</a> [[!HTML]]. This includes
simple types such as <a>String</a> primitive values and <a>Date</a>
objects as well as <a>Object</a> and <a>Array</a> instances, {{File}}
objects, {{Blob}} objects, {{ImageData}} objects, and so on. Record
<a for=/>values</a> are stored and retrieved by value rather than by
reference; later changes to a value have no effect on the record
stored in the database.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=key-construct>Keys</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

In order to efficiently retrieve <a>records</a> stored in an indexed
database, each <a>record</a> is organized according to its
<dfn>key</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=key>

A <a for=/>key</a> has an associated <dfn>type</dfn> which is one of:
<i>number</i>,
<i>date</i>,
<i>string</i>,
<i>binary</i>,
or
<i>array</i>.

<aside class=note>&#9752; Support for <i>binary</i> keys is new in this edition. &#9752;</aside>

A <a for=/>key</a> also has an associated <dfn>value</dfn>, which will
be either:
an {{unrestricted double}} if type is <i>number</i> or <i>date</i>,
a {{DOMString}} if type is <i>string</i>,
a list of <a>octets</a> if type is <i>binary</i>,
or a list of other <a for=/>keys</a> if type is <i>array</i>.

</div>

An ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]] value can be converted to a <a for=/>key</a> by
following the steps to <a>convert a value to a key</a>.

<aside class=note>
The following ECMAScript types are valid keys:

* <a>Number</a> primitive values, except NaN. This includes Infinity and -Infinity.
* <a>Date</a> objects, except where the [<span>[</span>DateValue]] internal slot is NaN
* <a>String</a> primitive values.
* <a>ArrayBuffer</a> objects (or views on buffers such as <a>Uint8Array</a>).
* <a>Array</a> objects, where every item is defined, is itself a valid key, and does not directly or indirectly contain itself. This includes empty arrays. Arrays may contain other arrays.

Attempting to convert other ECMAScript values to a <a for=/>key</a> will fail.
</aside>

An <dfn>array key</dfn> is a <a for=/>key</a> with <a
for=key>type</a> <i>array</i>. The <dfn>subkeys</dfn> of an
<a>array key</a> are the members of the <a>array key</a>'s <a
for=key>value</a> list.

To <dfn>compare two keys</dfn> |a| and |b|, run these steps:

1. Let |ta| be the <a for=key>type</a> of |a|.

2. Let |tb| be the <a for=key>type</a> of |b|.

3. If |ta| is <i>array</i> and |tb| is
    <i>binary</i>, <i>string</i>, <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return 1.
4. If |tb| is <i>array</i> and |ta| is
    <i>binary</i>, <i>string</i>, <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return -1.

5. If |ta| is <i>binary</i> and |tb| is
    <i>string</i>, <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return 1.
6. If |tb| is <i>binary</i> and |ta| is
    <i>string</i>, <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return -1.

7. If |ta| is <i>string</i> and |tb| is
    <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return 1.
8. If |tb| is <i>string</i> and |ta| is
    <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return -1.

9. If |ta| is <i>date</i> and |tb| is
    <i>number</i>,
    return 1.
10. If |tb| is <i>date</i> and |ta| is
    <i>number</i>,
    return -1.

11. Assert: |ta| and |tb| are equal.

12. Let |va| be the <a for=key>value</a> of |a|.
13. Let |vb| be the <a for=key>value</a> of |b|.

14. Switch on |ta|:

            1. Let |u| be the code unit of |va| at index |i|
            2. Let |v| be the code unit of |vb| at index |i|

            2. Let |v| be the <a>octet</a> in |vb| at index |i|

<h3 id=index-construct>Index</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

It is sometimes useful to retrieve <a>records</a> in an <a for=/>object
store</a> through other means than their <a for=/>key</a>. An <dfn id=index-concept>index</dfn> allows looking up <a>records</a> in an
<a for=/>object store</a> using properties of the <a for=/>values</a> in the
<a for=/>object stores</a> <a>records</a>.

<div dfn-for=index>

An index is a specialized persistent key-value storage and has a <dfn>referenced</dfn> <a for=/>object store</a>.
The index has a <dfn>list of records</dfn> which hold the data stored in the index.
The records in an index are automatically populated whenever records
in the <a>referenced</a> object store are inserted, updated or
deleted. There can be several <a for=/>indexes</a> referencing the same
<a for=/>object store</a>, in which changes to the object store cause all
such indexes to get updated.

The values in the index's <a>records</a> are always values of
<a for=/>keys</a> in the index's <a>referenced</a> object store. The keys
are derived from the referenced object store's <a for=/>values</a> using a
<dfn>key path</dfn>. If a
given <a>record</a> with key |X| in the object store
referenced by the index has the value |A|, and <a
data-lt="extract a key from a value using a key path">evaluating</a>
the index's <a for=index>key path</a> on |A|
yields the result |Y|, then the index will contain a record
with key |Y| and value |X|.

<aside class=example>
  For example, if an index's <a>referenced</a> object store contains a
  record with the key <code>123</code> and the value <code>{ first:
  "Alice", last: "Smith" }</code>, and the index's <a for=index>key
  path</a> is "<code>first</code>" then the index would contain a
  record with the key "<code>Alice</code>" and the value
  <code>123</code>.
</aside>

Records in an index are said to have a <dfn>referenced value</dfn>.
This is the value of the record in the index's referenced object store
which has a key equal to the index's record's value. So in the example
above, the record in the index whose key is |Y| and value is
|X| has a <a>referenced value</a> of |A|.

<aside class=example>
  In the preceding example, the record in the index with key
  "<code>Alice</code>" and value <code>123</code> would have a
  <a>referenced value</a> of <code>{ first: "Alice", last: "Smith"
  }</code>.
</aside>

<aside class=note>
Each record in an index references one and only one record in the
index's <a>referenced</a> object store. However there can be multiple
records in an index which reference the same record in the object
store. And there can also be no records in an index which reference a
given record in an object store.
</aside>

The <a>records</a> in an index are always sorted according to the
<a>record</a>'s key. However unlike object stores, a given index can
contain multiple records with the same key. Such records are
additionally sorted according to the <a for=/>index</a>'s <a>record</a>'s
value (meaning the key of the record in the referenced <a for=/>object
store</a>).

An <a for=/>index</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn>. The name can be any string value,
including the empty string. At any one time, the name is unique within
index's <a>referenced</a> <a for=/>object store</a>. Index names are always
compared in a case-sensitive manner, as opaque sequences of 16-bit
code units.

An <a for=/>index</a> has a <dfn>unique flag</dfn>. When this flag is set,
the index enforces that no two <a>records</a> in the index has the
same key. If a <a>record</a> in the index's referenced object store is
attempted to be inserted or modified such that evaluating the index's
key path on the records new value yields a result which already exists
in the index, then the attempted modification to the object store
fails.

An <a for=/>index</a> has a <dfn>multiEntry flag</dfn>. This flag affects
how the index behaves when the result of evaluating the index's <a
for=index>key path</a> yields an <a>array key</a>. If
the <a>multiEntry flag</a> is unset, then a single <a>record</a> whose
<a for=/>key</a> is an <a>array key</a> is added to the index. If the
<a>multiEntry flag</a> is true, then the one <a>record</a> is added to
the index for each of the <a>subkeys</a>.

<h4 id=index-handle-construct>Index Handle</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with <a for=/>indexes</a> directly. Instead, within
a <a for=/>transaction</a>, script has indirect access via an <dfn>index
handle</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=index-handle>

An <a>index handle</a> has an associated <dfn>index</dfn> and an
associated <dfn>object store handle</dfn>. The <dfn>transaction</dfn>
of an <a>index handle</a> is the <a

the same <a for=/>index</a> in different <a for=/>transactions</a>,
but there MUST be only one <a>index handle</a> associated with a
particular <a for=/>index</a> within a <a for=/>transaction</a>.

An <a>index handle</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is initialized to
the <a for=index>name</a> of the associated <a
for=index-handle>index</a> when the <a>index handle</a> is created.
The name will remain constant except when an <a>upgrade

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=transaction-construct>Transactions</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn id=transaction-concept>Transaction</dfn> is used to interact
with the data in a <a>database</a>. Whenever data is read or written
to the database it is done by using a <a for=/>transaction</a>.

<div dfn-for=transaction>

<a for=/>Transactions</a> offer some protection from application and system
failures. A <a for=/>transaction</a> may be used to store multiple data
records or to conditionally modify certain data records. A
<a for=/>transaction</a> represents an atomic and durable set of data access
and data mutation operations.

All transactions are created through a <a for=/>connection</a>, which is the
transaction's <dfn>connection</dfn>.

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has a <dfn>scope</dfn> that
determines the <a for=/>object stores</a> with which the transaction may
interact. A transaction's scope remains fixed for the lifetime of that
transaction.

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has a <dfn>mode</dfn> that
determines which types of interactions can be performed upon that
transaction. The <a>mode</a> is set when the transaction is created
and remains fixed for the life of the transaction. A
<a for=/>transaction</a>'s <a>mode</a> is one of the following:

<dl>
  <dt>{{"readonly"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is only allowed to read data. No modifications can
    be done by this type of transaction. This has the advantage that
    several <a>read-only transactions</a> can run at the same time
    even if their <a>scopes</a> are overlapping, i.e. if they are
    using the same object stores. This type of transaction can be
    created any time once a database has been opened.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"readwrite"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is allowed to read, modify and delete data from
    existing object stores. However object stores and indexes can't be
    added or removed. Multiple {{"readwrite"}} transactions
    can't run at the same time if their <a>scopes</a> are overlapping
    since that would mean that they can modify each other's data in
    the middle of the transaction. This type of transaction can be
    created any time once a database has been opened.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"versionchange"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is allowed to read, modify and delete data from
    existing object stores, and can also create and remove object
    stores and indexes. It is the only type of transaction that can do
    so. This type of transaction can't be manually created, but
    instead is created automatically when an <a>upgradeneeded</a>
    event is fired.
  </dd>
</dl>

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has an <dfn>active flag</dfn>, which determines
if new <a>requests</a> can be made against the transaction. A
transaction is said to be <dfn>active</dfn> if its <a>active flag</a>
is set.

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has a <dfn>request list</dfn> of <a>requests</a>
which have been made against the transaction.

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has a <dfn>error</dfn> which is set if the
<a for=/>transaction</a> is <a>aborted</a>.

A <a for=/>transaction</a>'s <a>get the parent</a> algorithm returns the
transaction's <a for=transaction>connection</a>.

Transactions are expected to be short lived. This is encouraged by the
<a for=transaction lt=commit>automatic committing</a> functionality
described below.

<aside class=note>
  Authors can still cause transactions to run for a long time; however,
  this usage pattern is not generally recommended as it can lead to a
  bad user experience.
</aside>

The <dfn>lifetime</dfn> of a
<a for=/>transaction</a> is as follows:

1. A transaction is <dfn>created</dfn> with a <a>scope</a> and a <a>mode</a>.
    When a transaction is created its <a>active flag</a> is initially set.

2. The implementation MUST allow <a>requests</a> to be <a
    for=request>placed</a> against the transaction
    whenever the <a>active flag</a> is set. This is the case even if
    the transaction has not yet been <a>started</a>. Until the transaction is <a>started</a> the implementation MUST
    NOT execute these requests; however, the implementation MUST keep
    track of the <a>requests</a> and their order. Requests may be
    placed against a transaction only while that transaction is
    <a>active</a>. If an attempt is made to place a request against a
    transaction when that transaction is not <a>active</a>, the
    implementation MUST reject the attempt by throwing a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}} exception.

3. Once an implementation is able to enforce the constraints defined
    for the transaction <a>scope</a> and <a>mode</a>, defined below,
    the implementation MUST <a>queue a task</a> to <dfn lt="start|started">start</dfn> the transaction
    asynchronously.

4. Once the transaction has been <a>started</a> the implementation can start executing the
    <a>requests</a> placed against the transaction. Unless otherwise
    defined, requests MUST be executed in the order in which they were
    made against the transaction. Likewise, their results MUST be
    returned in the order the requests were placed against a specific
    transaction. There is no guarantee about the order that results
    from requests in different transactions are returned. Similarly,
    the transaction <a>modes</a> ensure that two requests placed
    against different transactions can execute in any order without
    affecting what resulting data is stored in the database.

5. A transaction can be <dfn lt="abort|aborting|aborted">aborted</dfn>
    at any time before it is <a>finished</a>, even if the transaction isn't currently
    <a>active</a> or hasn't yet <a>started</a>. When a transaction is aborted the
    implementation MUST undo (roll back) any changes that were made to
    the <a>database</a> during that transaction. This includes both
    changes to the contents of <a for=/>object stores</a> as well as
    additions and removals of <a for=/>object stores</a> and <a for=/>indexes</a>.

6. A transaction can fail for reasons not tied to a particular
    <a>request</a>. For example due to IO errors when committing the
    transaction, or due to running into a quota limit where the
    implementation can't tie exceeding the quota to a partcular
    request. In this case the implementation MUST run the <a>steps for
    aborting a transaction</a> using the transaction as
    |transaction| and the appropriate error type as
    |error|. For example if quota was exceeded then
    {{QuotaExceededError}} should be used as |error|, and
    if an IO error happened, {{UnknownError}} should be used as
    |error|.

7. When a transaction can no longer become <a>active</a>, the
    implementation MUST attempt to <dfn lt="commit|committing|committed">commit</dfn> it, as long as the transaction has not been
    <a>aborted</a>. This usually happens
    after all requests placed against the transaction have been
    executed and their returned results handled, and no new requests
    have been placed against the transaction. When a transaction is
    committed, the implementation MUST atomically write any changes to
    the <a>database</a> made by requests placed against the
    transaction. That is, either all of the changes MUST be written,
    or if an error occurs, such as a disk write error, the
    implementation MUST NOT write any of the changes to the database.
    If such an error occurs, the implementation MUST <a>abort</a> the transaction by following
    the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a>, otherwise it MUST <a
    for=transaction>commit</a> the transaction by
    following the <a>steps for committing a transaction</a>.

8. When a transaction is <a for=transaction>committed</a>
    or <a>aborted</a>, it is said to be
    <dfn lt="finish|finished">finished</dfn>. If a transaction
    can't be finished, for example due to the implementation crashing
    or the user taking some explicit action to cancel it, the
    implementation MUST <a>abort</a> the
    transaction.

A <dfn>read-only transaction</dfn> is
a <a for=/>transaction</a> with <a>mode</a> {{"readonly"}}.

A <dfn>read/write transaction</dfn>
is a <a for=/>transaction</a> with <a>mode</a> {{"readwrite"}}.

The following constraints define when a <a for=/>transaction</a> can be <a>started</a>:

* Any number of <a>read-only transactions</a> are allowed to run
    concurrently, even if the transaction's <a>scope</a> overlap and
    include the same <a for=/>object stores</a>. As long as a <a>read-only
    transaction</a> is running, the data that the implementation
    returns through <a>requests</a> created with that transaction MUST
    remain constant. That is, two requests to read the same piece of
    data MUST yield the same result both for the case when data is
    found and the result is that data, and for the case when data is
    not found and a lack of data is indicated.

    <aside class=note>
      There are a number of ways that an implementation can ensure
      this. The implementation could prevent any <a>read/write
      transaction</a>, whose scope overlaps the scope of the
      <a>read-only transaction</a>, from starting until the
      <a>read-only transaction</a> finishes. Or the implementation
      could allow the <a>read-only transaction</a> to see a snapshot
      of the contents of the <a for=/>object stores</a> which is taken when
      the <a>read-only transaction</a> started.
    </aside>

* Similarly, implementations MUST ensure that a <a>read/write
    transaction</a> is only affected by changes to <a for=/>object
    stores</a> that are made using the transaction itself. For
    example, the implementation MUST ensure that another transaction
    does not modify the contents of <a for=/>object stores</a> in the
    <a>read/write transaction</a>'s <a>scope</a>. The implementation
    MUST also ensure that if the <a>read/write transaction</a>
    completes successfully, the changes written to <a for=/>object
    stores</a> using the transaction can be committed to the
    <a>database</a> without merge conflicts. An implementation MUST
    NOT abort a transaction due to merge conflicts.

* If multiple <a>read/write transactions</a> are attempting to access
    the same object store (i.e. if they have overlapping
    <a>scope</a>), the transaction that was <a>created</a> first MUST be the transaction which gets
    access to the object store first. Due to the requirements in the
    previous paragraph, this also means that it is the only
    transaction which has access to the object store until the
    transaction is <a>finished</a>.

* Any transaction <a>created</a> after a
    <a>read/write transaction</a> MUST see the changes written by the
    <a>read/write transaction</a>. So if a <a>read/write
    transaction</a>, A, is created, and later another transaction B,
    is created, and the two transactions have overlapping
    <a>scopes</a>, then B MUST see any changes made to any <a for=/>object
    stores</a> that are part of that overlapping <a>scope</a>. Due to
    the requirements in the previous paragraph, this also means that
    the B transaction does not have access to any <a for=/>object stores</a>
    in that overlapping <a>scope</a> until the A transaction is <a>finished</a>.

    <aside class=note>
      Generally speaking, the above requirements mean that any
      transaction which has an overlapping scope with a <a>read/write
      transaction</a> and which was created after that <a>read/write
      transaction</a>, can't run in parallel with that <a>read/write
      transaction</a>.
    </aside>

* User agents MUST ensure a reasonable level of fairness across
    transactions to prevent starvation. For example, if multiple
    <a>read-only transactions</a> are started one after another the
    implementation MUST NOT indefinitely prevent a pending
    <a>read/write transaction</a> from <a>starting</a>.

<h4 id=upgrade-transaction-construct>Upgrade Transactions</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>upgrade transaction</dfn> is a
<a for=/>transaction</a> with <a>mode</a> {{"versionchange"}}.

An <a>upgrade transaction</a> is automatically created when running
<a>steps for running an upgrade transaction</a> after a
<a for=/>connection</a> is opened to a <a>database</a> giving a greater <a
for=database>version</a> than the current <a for=database>version</a>.
This <a for=/>transaction</a> will be active inside the <a>upgradeneeded</a>
event handler, allowing the creation of new <a for=/>object stores</a> and
<a for=/>indexes</a>.

An <a>upgrade transaction</a> is never run concurrently with other
transactions. When a database is opened with a <a
for=database>version</a> number higher than the current <a
for=database>version</a>, a new <a>upgrade transaction</a> is
automatically created and made available through the <a>open
request</a> when the <a>upgradeneeded</a> event is fired. The
<a>upgradeneeded</a> event isn't fired, and thus the <a>upgrade
transaction</a> isn't started, until all other <a for=/>connections</a> to
the same <a>database</a> are closed. This ensures that all other
transactions are <a>finished</a>.

As long as an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is running, attempts to open
more <a for=/>connections</a> to the same <a>database</a> are delayed, and
any attempts to use the same <a for=/>connection</a> to start additional
transactions will result in an exception being thrown. Thus <a>upgrade
transactions</a> not only ensure that no other transactions are
running concurrently, but also ensure that no other transactions are
queued against the same <a>database</a> as long as the transaction is
running.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=request-construct>Requests</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each asynchronous operation on a <a>database</a> is done using a <dfn>request</dfn>. Every request represents one
operation.

<div dfn-for=request>

A <a>request</a> has a <dfn>done flag</dfn> which is initially unset.

A <a>request</a> has a <dfn>source</dfn> object.

A <a>request</a> has a <dfn>result</dfn> and
an <dfn>error</dfn>, neither
of which are accessible until the <a>done flag</a> is set.

A <a>request</a> has a <dfn>transaction</dfn> which is initially
null. This will be set when a request is <dfn>placed</dfn> against a <a for=/>transaction</a> using the <a>steps
for asynchronously executing a request</a>.

When a request is made, a new <a>request</a> is returned with its
<a>done flag</a> unset. If a request completes successfully, the
<a>done flag</a> is set, the <a for=request>result</a> is
set to the result of the request, and an event with type
<code>success</code> is fired at the <a>request</a>.

If an error occurs while performing the operation, the <a>done
flag</a> is set, the <a for=request>error</a> is set to
the error, and an event with type <code>error</code> is fired at the
request.

A <a>request</a>'s <a>get the parent</a> algorithm
returns the request's <a for=request>transaction</a>.

An <dfn>open request</dfn> is a special type of <a>request</a> used
when opening a <a for=/>connection</a> or deleting a <a>database</a>. In
addition to <code>success</code> and <code>error</code> events,
<a>blocked</a> and <a>upgradeneeded</a> may be fired at an <a>open
request</a> to indicate progress.

The <a for=request>source</a> of an <a>open request</a>
is always null.

The <a for=request>transaction</a> of an <a>open
request</a> is null unless an <a>upgradeneeded</a> event has been
fired.

An <a>open request</a>'s <a>get the parent</a> algorithm returns null.

<aside class=note>
  Requests are not typically re-used, but there are exceptions. When a
  <a>cursor</a> is iterated, the success of the iteration is reported
  on the same <a>request</a> object used to open the cursor. And when
  an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is necessary, the same <a>open
  request</a> is used for both the <a>upgradeneeded</a> event and
  final result of the open operation itself. In both cases, the
  request's <a>done flag</a> will be unset then set again, and the <a
  for=request>result</a> may change.

Records can be retrieved from <a for=/>object stores</a> and <a for=/>indexes</a>
using either <a for=/>keys</a> or <a>key ranges</a>. A <dfn>key range</dfn> is a continuous interval over some data type
used for keys.

A <a>key range</a> has an associated <dfn>lower bound</dfn> (null or a
<a for=/>key</a>).

A <a>key range</a> has an associated <dfn>upper bound</dfn> (null or a

A <a>key range</a> has an associated <dfn>lower open flag</dfn>.
Unless otherwise stated it is unset.

A <a>key range</a> has an associated <dfn>upper open flag</dfn>.
Unless otherwise stated it is unset.

A <a>key range</a> MAY have a <a>lower bound</a> <a>equal to</a> its
<a>upper bound</a>. A <a>key range</a> MUST NOT have a <a>lower
bound</a> <a>greater than</a> its <a>upper bound</a>.

A <a>key range</a> <dfn>containing only</dfn> |key| has both
<a>lower bound</a> and <a>upper bound</a> equal to |key|.

A |key| is <dfn>in a key range</dfn> if both of the following
conditions are fulfilled:

    |key|, or it is both <a>equal to</a> |key| and
    the <a>lower open flag</a> is unset.

* The <a>upper bound</a> is null, or it is <a>greater than</a>
    |key|, or it is both <a>equal to</a> |key| and
    the <a>upper open flag</a> is unset.

<aside class=note>

  * If the <a>lower open flag</a> of a <a>key range</a> is unset, the
    <a>lower bound</a> <a for=/>key</a> of the <a>key range</a> is included

follows:

1. If |value| is a <a>key range</a>, return |value|.

2. If |value| is undefined or is null, then <a>throw</a> a

    set, or return an <a>unbounded key range</a> otherwise.

3. Let |key| be the result of running the steps to <a>convert
    a value to a key</a> with |value|. Rethrow any exceptions.

4. If |key| is invalid, <a>throw</a> a {{DataError}}
    exception.

5. Return a <a>key range</a> <a>containing only</a> |key|.

<h3 id=cursor-construct>Cursor</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>cursor</dfn> is used to iterate over a range of records in an
<a for=/>index</a> or an <a for=/>object store</a> in a specific direction.

<div dfn-for=cursor>

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>transaction</dfn>, the <a for=/>transaction</a>
that was <a>active</a> when the cursor was created.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>range</dfn> of records in either an
<a for=/>index</a> or an <a for=/>object store</a>.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>source</dfn> that indicates which <a for=/>index</a>
or an <a for=/>object store</a> is associated with the records over which
the <a>cursor</a> is iterating.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>direction</dfn> that determines whether it
moves in monotonically increasing or decreasing order of the
<a>record</a> keys when iterated, and if it skips duplicated values
when iterating indexes. The direction of a cursor also determines if
the cursor initial position is at the start of its <a
for=cursor>source</a> or at its end. A cursor's
<a>direction</a> is one of the following:

<dl>
  <dt>{{"next"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
    <a for=cursor>source</a>. When iterated, the
    <a>cursor</a> should yield all records, including duplicates, in
    monotonically increasing order of keys.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"nextunique"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
    <a for=cursor>source</a>. When iterated, the
    <a>cursor</a> should not yield records with the same key, but
    otherwise yield all records, in monotonically increasing order of
    keys. For every key with duplicate values, only the first record
    is yielded. When the <a for=cursor>source</a> is an
    <a for=/>object store</a> or an <a for=/>index</a> with the <a>unique flag</a>
    set, this direction has exactly the same behavior as
    {{"next"}}.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"prev"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the <a
    for=cursor>source</a>. When iterated, the
    <a>cursor</a> should yield all records, including duplicates, in
    monotonically decreasing order of keys.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"prevunique"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the <a
    for=cursor>source</a>. When iterated, the
    <a>cursor</a> should not yield records with the same key, but
    otherwise yield all records, in monotonically decreasing order of
    keys. For every key with duplicate values, only the first record
    is yielded. When the <a for=cursor>source</a> is an
    <a for=/>object store</a> or an <a for=/>index</a> with the <a>unique flag</a>
    set, this direction has exactly the same behavior as
    {{"prev"}}.
  </dd>
</dl>

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>position</dfn> within its range. It is
possible for the list of records which the cursor is iterating over to
change before the full <a>range</a> of the cursor has been iterated.
In order to handle this, cursors maintain their <a>position</a> not as
an index, but rather as a <a for=/>key</a> of the previously returned
record. For a forward iterating cursor, the next time the cursor is
asked to iterate to the next record it returns the record with the
lowest <a for=/>key</a> <a>greater than</a> the one previously returned. For
a backwards iterating cursor, the situation is opposite and it returns
the record with the highest <a for=/>key</a> <a>less than</a> the one
previously returned.

For cursors iterating indexes the situation is a little bit more
complicated since multiple records can have the same key and are
therefore also sorted by <a for=/>value</a>. When iterating indexes the
<a>cursor</a> also has an <dfn>object store position</dfn>, which
indicates the <a for=/>value</a> of the previously found <a>record</a> in
the index. Both <a>position</a> and the <a>object store position</a>
are used when finding the next appropriate record.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>key</dfn> and a <dfn>value</dfn> which represent the <a for=/>key</a> and
the <a for=/>value</a> of the last iterated <a>record</a>.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>got value flag</dfn>. When this flag unset,
the cursor is either in the process of loading the next value or it
has reached the end of its <a>range</a>. When it is set, it indicates
that the cursor is currently holding a value and that it is ready to
iterate to the next one.

If the <a for=cursor>source</a> of a cursor is an
<a for=/>object store</a>, the <dfn>effective object store</dfn> of the
cursor is that object store and the <dfn>effective key</dfn> of the
cursor is the cursor's <a>position</a>. If the <a
for=cursor>source</a> of a cursor is an <a for=/>index</a>, the
<a>effective object store</a> of the cursor is that index's
<a>referenced</a> object store and the <a>effective key</a> is the
cursor's <a>object store position</a>.

A <a>cursor</a> also has a <dfn>key only flag</dfn>, that indicates
whether the cursor's <a for=cursor>value</a> is exposed
via the API. Unless stated otherwise it is unset.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=key-generator-construct>Key Generators</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When a <a for=/>object store</a> is created it can be specified to use a
<dfn>key generator</dfn>. A <a>key
generator</a> keeps an internal <dfn>current number</dfn>. The
<a>current number</a> is always a positive integer. Whenever the key
generator is used to generate a new <a for=/>key</a>, the generator's
<a>current number</a> is returned and <strong>then</strong>
incremented to prepare for the next time a new <a for=/>key</a> is needed.
Implementations MUST use the following rules for generating numbers
when a <a>key generator</a> is used.

* Every object store that uses key generators use a separate
    generator. I.e. interacting with one object store never affects
    the key generator of any other object store.

* The <a>current number</a> of a <a>key generator</a> is always set to
    1 when the <a for=/>object store</a> for that key generator is first
    created.

* When a key generator is used to generate a new <a for=/>key</a> for a
    <a for=/>object store</a>, the key generator's <a>current number</a> is
    used as the new key value and then the key generator's <a>current
    number</a> is increased by 1.

* When a <a>record</a> is stored and a <a for=/>key</a> is specified in the
    call to store the record, if <a for=key>type</a> of the
    key is <i>number</i> and the <a for=key>value</a> is
    greater than or equal to the key generator's <a>current
    number</a>, then the key generator's <a>current number</a> is set
    to the smallest integer number <a>greater than</a> the explicit
    key. A key can be specified both for object stores which use
    <a>in-line keys</a>, by setting the property on the stored value
    which the object store's <a for=object-store>key path</a> points
    to, and for object stores which use <a>out-of-line keys</a>, by
    passing a key argument to the call to store the <a>record</a>.

    <aside class=note>
      Only specified keys of <a for=key>type</a>
      <i>number</i> may affect the <a>current number</a> of the key
      generator. Keys of <a for=key>type</a> <i>date</i>,
      <i>array</i> (regardless of the other keys they contain),
      <i>binary</i>, or <i>string</i> (regardless of whether they
      could be parsed as numbers) have no effect on the <a>current
      number</a> of the key generator. Keys of <a
      for=key>type</a> <i>number</i> with <a
      for=key>value</a> less than 1 do not affect the
      <a>current number</a> since they are always lower than the
      <a>current number</a>.
    </aside>

* Modifying a key generator's <a>current number</a> is considered part
    of a database operation. This means that if the operation fails
    and the operation is reverted, the <a>current number</a> is
    reverted to the value it had before the operation started. This
    applies both to modifications that happen due to the <a>current
    number</a> getting increased by 1 when the key generator is used,
    and to modifications that happen due to a <a>record</a> being
    stored with a key value specified in the call to store the
    <a>record</a>.

* Likewise, if a <a for=/>transaction</a> is aborted, the <a>current
    number</a> of the key generator for each <a for=/>object store</a> in
    the transaction's <a>scope</a> is reverted to the value it had
    before the <a for=/>transaction</a> was started.

* When the <a>current number</a> of a key generator reaches above the
    value 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992) any attempts to use the
    key generator to generate a new <a for=/>key</a> will result in a
    {{ConstraintError}}. It is still possible to insert
    <a>records</a> into the object store by specifying an explicit
    key, however the only way to use a key generator again for the
    object store is to delete the object store and create a new one.

    <aside class=note>
      As long as key generators are used in a normal fashion this will
      not be a problem. If you generate a new key 1000 times per
      second day and night, you won't run into this limit for over
      285000 years.
    </aside>

* The <a>current number</a> for a key generator never decreases, other
    than as a result of database operations being reverted. Deleting a
    <a>record</a> from an <a for=/>object store</a> never affects the object
    store's key generator. Even clearing all records from an object
    store, for example using the {{clear()}} method,
    does not affect the <a>current number</a> of the object store's
    key generator.

A practical result of this is that the first key generated for an
object store is always 1 (unless a higher numeric key is inserted
first) and the key generated for an object store is always a positive
integer higher than the highest numeric key in the store. The same key
is never generated twice for the same object store unless a
transaction is rolled back.

<aside class=example>

Each object store gets its own key generator:

<pre class=lang-javascript>
store1 = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store1.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store2 = db.createObjectStore("store2", { autoIncrement: true });
store2.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store1.put("b"); // Will get key 2
store2.put("b"); // Will get key 2
</pre>

If an insertion fails due to constraint violations or IO error, the
key generator is not updated.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
transaction.onerror = function(e) { e.preventDefault() };
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
index = store.createIndex("index1", "ix", { unique: true });
store.put({ ix: "a"}); // Will get key 1
store.put({ ix: "a"}); // Will fail
store.put({ ix: "b"}); // Will get key 2
</pre>

Removing items from an objectStore never affects the key generator.
Including when {{clear()}} is called.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store.delete(1);
store.put("b"); // Will get key 2
store.clear();
store.put("c"); // Will get key 3
store.delete(IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(0));
store.put("d"); // Will get key 4
</pre>

Inserting an item with an explicit key affects the key generator if,
and only if, the key is numeric and higher than the last generated
key.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store.put("b", 3); // Will use key 3
store.put("c"); // Will get key 4
store.put("d", -10); // Will use key -10
store.put("e"); // Will get key 5
store.put("f", 6.00001); // Will use key 6.0001
store.put("g"); // Will get key 7
store.put("f", 8.9999); // Will use key 8.9999
store.put("g"); // Will get key 9
store.put("h", "foo"); // Will use key "foo"
store.put("i"); // Will get key 10
store.put("j", [1000]); // Will use key [1000]
store.put("k"); // Will get key 11
// All of these would behave the same if the objectStore used a
// keyPath and the explicit key was passed inline in the object
</pre>

Aborting a transaction rolls back any increases to the key generator
which happened during the transaction. This is to make all rollbacks
consistent since rollbacks that happen due to crash never has a chance
to commit the increased key generator value.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
db.createObjectStore("store", { autoIncrement: true });
trans1 = db.transaction(["store"], "readwrite");
store_t1 = trans1.objectStore("store");
store_t1.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store_t1.put("b"); // Will get key 2
trans1.abort();
trans2 = db.transaction(["store"], "readwrite");
store_t2 = trans2.objectStore("store");
store_t2.put("c"); // Will get key 1
store_t2.put("d"); // Will get key 2
</pre>
</aside>

<aside class=example>

The following examples illustrate the different behaviors when trying
to use in-line <a for=/>keys</a> and <a>key generators</a> to save an object
to an <a for=/>object store</a>.

If the following conditions are true:

* The <a for=/>object store</a> has a <a>key generator</a>.

* There is no in-line value for the <a for=object-store>key path</a>
    property.

Then the value provided by the <a>key generator</a> is used to
populate the key value. In the example below the <a
for=object-store>key path</a> for the object store is
"<code>foo.bar</code>". The actual object has no value for the
<code>bar</code> property, <code>{ foo: {} }</code>. When the object
is saved in the <a for=/>object store</a> the <code>bar</code> property is
assigned a value of 1 because that is the next <a for=/>key</a> generated by
the <a>key generator</a>.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar", autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ foo: {} }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 1);
};
</pre>

If the following conditions are true:

* The <a for=/>object store</a> has a <a>key generator</a>.

* There is a value for the <a for=object-store>key path</a>
    property.

Then the value associated with the <a for=object-store>key path</a>
property is used. The auto-generated <a for=/>key</a> is not used. In the
example below the <a for=object-store>key path</a> for the <a for=/>object
store</a> is "<code>foo.bar</code>". The actual object has a value of
10 for the <code>bar</code> property, <code>{ foo: { bar: 10}
}</code>. When the object is saved in the <a for=/>object store</a> the
<code>bar</code> property keeps its value of 10, because that is the
key value.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar", autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ foo: { bar: 10 } }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 10);
};
</pre>

The following example illustrates the scenario when the specified
in-line <a for=/>key</a> is defined through a <a for=object-store>key
path</a> but there is no property matching it. The value provided by
the <a>key generator</a> is then used to populate the key value and
the system is responsible for creating as many properties as it
requires to suffice the property dependencies on the hierarchy chain.
In the example below the <a for=object-store>key path</a> for the
<a for=/>object store</a> is "<code>foo.bar.baz</code>". The actual object
has no value for the <code>foo</code> property, <code>{ zip: {}
}</code>. When the object is saved in the <a for=/>object store</a> the
<code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and <code>baz</code> properties
are created each as a child of the other until a value for
<code>foo.bar.baz</code> can be assigned. The value for
<code>foo.bar.baz</code> is the next key generated by the object
store.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar.baz", autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ zip: {} }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 1);
  store.get(key).onsuccess = function(e) {
    var value = e.target.result;
    // value will be: { zip: {}, foo: { bar: { baz: 1 } } }
    console.assert(value.foo.bar.baz === 1);
  };
};
</pre>

Attempting to store a property on a primitive value will fail and
throw an error. In the first example below the <a for=object-store>key
path</a> for the object store is "<code>foo</code>". The actual object
is a primitive with the value, <code>4</code>. Trying to define a
property on that primitive value fails. The same is true for arrays.
Properties are not allowed on an array. In the second example below,
the actual object is an array, <code>[10]</code>. Trying to define a
property on the array fails.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo", autoIncrement: true });

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path property on this primitive.
store.put(4); // will throw DataError

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path property on this array.
store.put([10]); // will throw DataError

<h2 id=async-api>API</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The API methods return without blocking the calling thread. All
asynchronous operations immediately return an {{IDBRequest}}
instance. This object does not initially contain any information about
the result of the operation. Once information becomes available, an
event is fired on the request and the information becomes available
through the properties of the {{IDBRequest}} instance.

The <span>task source</span> for these tasks is the <dfn

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=request-api>The {{IDBRequest}} interface</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The {{IDBRequest}} interface provides the means to access results of
asynchronous requests to <a>databases</a> and <a>database</a>
objects using <a>event handler IDL attributes</a> [[!HTML]].

Every method for making asynchronous requests returns an
{{IDBRequest}} object that communicates back to the requesting
application through events. This design means that any number of
requests can be active on any <a>database</a> at a time.

<aside class=example>

In the following example, we open a <a>database</a> asynchronously.
Various event handlers are registered for responding to various

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>error</dfn> attribute's getter must
<a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception if the <a>done

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>source</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the <a for=request>source</a> of the <a>request</a>, or null if
no <a for=request>source</a> is set.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>transaction</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the <a for=request>transaction</a> of the <a>request</a>.
This property can be null for certain requests, such as for

[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBOpenDBRequest : IDBRequest {
  // Event handlers:
  attribute EventHandler onblocked;
  attribute EventHandler onupgradeneeded;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBOpenDBRequest>onblocked</dfn> attribute is
the event handler for the <a>blocked</a> event.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBOpenDBRequest>onupgradeneeded</dfn>
attribute is the event handler for the <a>upgradeneeded</a> event.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=events>Event interfaces</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

This specification fires events with the following custom interfaces:

<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker),
 Constructor(DOMString type, optional IDBVersionChangeEventInit eventInitDict)]
interface IDBVersionChangeEvent : Event {
  readonly attribute unsigned long long  oldVersion;
  readonly attribute unsigned long long? newVersion;
};

dictionary IDBVersionChangeEventInit : EventInit {
  unsigned long long  oldVersion = 0;
  unsigned long long? newVersion = null;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBVersionChangeEvent>oldVersion</dfn>
attribute getter returns the previous version of the database.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBVersionChangeEvent>newVersion</dfn>
attribute getter returns the new version of the database, or null if
the database is being deleted. See the <a>steps for running an upgrade
transaction</a>.

Events are constructed as defined in <a
href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#constructing-events">Constructing
events</a>, in [[!WHATWG-DOM]].

To <dfn>fire a version change event</dfn> named |e| at
|target| given |oldVersion| and
|newVersion|, dispatch an event at |target|.

The event MUST use the {{IDBVersionChangeEvent}} interface with its
{{Event/type}} set to |e|, its {{IDBVersionChangeEvent/oldVersion}}
attribute set to |oldVersion|, and its
{{IDBVersionChangeEvent/newVersion}} attribute set to |newVersion|.
This event MUST NOT bubble or be cancelable.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=factory-interface>The {{IDBFactory}} interface</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<a>Database</a> objects are accessed through methods on the
{{IDBFactory}} interface. A single object implementing this
interface is present in the global scope of environments that support
Indexed DB operations.

<pre class=idl>
[NoInterfaceObject]
interface IDBEnvironment {
  readonly attribute IDBFactory indexedDB;
};
Window implements IDBEnvironment;
WorkerGlobalScope implements IDBEnvironment;
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBEnvironment>indexedDB</dfn> attribute
provides applications a mechanism for accessing capabilities of
indexed databases.

<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBFactory {
  IDBOpenDBRequest open(DOMString name,
                        [EnforceRange] optional unsigned long long version);
  IDBOpenDBRequest deleteDatabase(DOMString name);

  short cmp(any first, any second);
};
</pre>


The <dfn method for=IDBFactory>open(|name|, |version|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. If |version| is 0 (zero), <a>throw</a> a <a>TypeError</a>.

2. Let |request| be a new <a>open request</a>.

3. <a>Queue a task</a> to run these substeps:

    1. Let |result| be the result of running the <a>steps for
        opening a database</a>, with the origin of the
        {{IDBEnvironment}} used to access this {{IDBFactory}},
        |name|, |version| if given and undefined
        otherwise, and |request|.

        <aside class=note>
          If |version| is not given and a <a>database</a>
          with that name already exists, a connection will be opened
          without changing the <a for=database>version</a>. If
          |version| is not given and no <a>database</a> with
          that name exists, a new <a>database</a> will be created with
          <a for=database>version</a> equal to 1.
        </aside>

    2. If |result| is an error, set the <a
        for=request>error</a> of |request| to
        |result| and dispatch an event at |request|.
        The event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and set the
        {{Event/type}} attribute to "<code>error</code>". The event
        does bubble but is not cancelable.

    3. Otherwise, set the <a for=request>result</a> of
        |request| to |result| and dispatch an event
        at |request|. The event must use the <a>Event</a>
        interface and set the {{Event/type}} attribute to
        "<code>success</code>". The event does not bubble and is not
        cancelable. If the steps above resulted in an <a>upgrade
        transaction</a> being run, then firing the
        "<code>success</code>" event MUST be done after the <a>upgrade
        transaction</a> completes.

        <aside class=note>
          The last requirement is to ensure that in case another
          version upgrade is about to happen, the success event is
          fired on the connection first so that the script gets a
          chance to register a listener for the
          <code>versionchange</code> event.
        </aside>

        <aside class=note>
          The firing of "<code>success</code>" or "<code>error</code>"
          events do not follow the normal steps to <a>fire a success
          event</a> or <a>fire an error event</a> as there is no
          active transaction at the time when they fire.
        </aside>

4. Return a new {{IDBOpenDBRequest}} object for |request|.


The <dfn method for=IDBFactory>deleteDatabase(|name|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |request| be a new <a>open request</a>.

2. <a>Queue a task</a> to run these substeps:

    1. Let |result| be the result of running the <a>steps for
        deleting a database</a>, with the origin of the
        {{IDBEnvironment}} used to access this {{IDBFactory}},
        |name|, and |request|.

    2. If |result| is an error set the <a
        for=request>error</a> of |request| to
        |result| and dispatch an event at |request|.
        The event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and set the
        {{Event/type}} attribute to "<code>error</code>". The event
        does bubble but is not cancelable.

    3. Otherwise, set the <a for=request>result</a> of
        |request| to undefined and <a>fire a version change
        event</a> named <code>success</code> at <a>request</a> with
        |result| and null.

        <aside class=note>
          The firing of "<code>success</code>" or "<code>error</code>"
          events do not follow the normal steps to <a>fire a success
          event</a> or <a>fire an error event</a> as there is no
          active transaction at the time when they fire.
        </aside>

3. Return a new {{IDBOpenDBRequest}} object for |request|.


The <dfn method for=IDBFactory>cmp(|first|, |second|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |a| be the result of running the steps to <a>convert a
    value to a key</a> with |first|. Rethrow any exceptions.

2. If |a| is invalid, <a>throw</a> a {{DataError}} exception.

3. Let |b| be the result of running the steps to <a>convert a
    value to a key</a> with |second|. Rethrow any exceptions.

4. If |b| is invalid, <a>throw</a> a {{DataError}} exception.

5. Return the results of running the steps to <a>compare two keys</a>
    with |a| and |b|.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=database-interface>The {{IDBDatabase}} interface</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The {{IDBDatabase}}
interface represents a <a for=/>connection</a> to a <a>database</a>.

An {{IDBDatabase}} object MUST NOT be garbage collected if its
associated <a for=/>connection</a>'s <a>close pending flag</a> is unset
and it has one or more event listeners registers whose type is one of
<code>abort</code>, <code>error</code>, or <code>versionchange</code>.

If an {{IDBDatabase}} object is garbage collected, the
associated <a for=/>connection</a> must be <a for=connection>closed</a>.

<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBDatabase : EventTarget {

};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBDatabase>name</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the <a for="database">name</a> of the <a>connected</a>
<a>database</a>. The attribute MUST return this name even if the
<a>close pending flag</a> is set on the <a for=/>connection</a>. In
other words, the value of this attribute stays constant for the
lifetime of the {{IDBDatabase}} instance.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBDatabase>version</dfn> attribute's getter
must return this <a for=/>connection</a>'s <a
for=connection>version</a>.

<aside class=note>
  As long as the <a for=/>connection</a> is open, this is the same as the
  connected <a>database</a>'s <a for=database>version</a>.

  Once the <a for=/>connection</a> has <a for=connection>closed</a>, this
  attribute will not reflect changes made with a later <a>upgrade
  transaction</a>.
</aside>


The <dfn attribute for=IDBDatabase>objectStoreNames</dfn> attribute's
getter must return a <a>sorted list</a> of the <a

<aside class=note>

  Once the <a for=/>connection</a> has <a for=connection>closed</a>, this
  attribute will not reflect changes made with a later <a>upgrade

</aside>


The <dfn method for=IDBDatabase>createObjectStore(|name|, |options|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |database| be the <a>database</a> associated with this
    <a for=/>connection</a>.

2. Let |transaction| be the currently running <a>upgrade
    transaction</a> associated with |database|, or
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception if none.

3. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}} exception.

4. If an <a for=/>object store</a> <a for=object-store>named</a>
    |name| already exists in |database| <a>throw</a>
    a {{ConstraintError}} exception.

5. Let |keyPath| be |options|'s
    {{IDBObjectStoreParameters/keyPath}} member if it is not undefined
    or null, or null otherwise.

6. If |keyPath| is not null and is not a <a>valid key
    path</a>, <a>throw</a> a {{SyntaxError}} exception.

7. Let |autoIncrement| be set if |options|'s
    {{IDBObjectStoreParameters/autoIncrement}} member is true, or unset otherwise.

8. If |autoIncrement| is set and |keyPath| is an
    empty string or any sequence (empty or otherwise), <a>throw</a> an
    {{InvalidAccessError}} exception.

9. Let |store| be a new <a for=/>object store</a> in
    |database|. Set the created <a for=/>object store</a>'s <a
    for=object-store>name</a> to |name|. If
    |autoIncrement| is set, then the created <a for=/>object
    store</a> uses a <a>key generator</a>. If |keyPath| is
    not null, set the created <a for=/>object store</a>'s <a
    for=object-store>key path</a> to |keyPath|.

10. Return a new <a for=/>object store handle</a> associated with
    |store| and |transaction|.

This method creates and returns a new <a for=/>object store</a> with the
given name in the <a>connected</a> <a>database</a>.
Note that this method must only be called from within an <a>upgrade
transaction</a>.

This method synchronously modifies the
{{IDBDatabase/objectStoreNames}} property on the {{IDBDatabase}}
instance on which it was called.

In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to run
into problems after queuing a task to create the <a for=/>object store</a>
after the {{createObjectStore()}} method has returned. For
example in implementations where metadata about the newly created
<a for=/>object store</a> is inserted into the database asynchronously, or
where the implementation might need to ask the user for permission for
quota reasons. Such implementations MUST still create and return an
{{IDBObjectStore}} object, and once the implementation determines
that creating the <a for=/>object store</a> has failed, it MUST abort the
transaction using the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> using
the appropriate error. For example if creating the <a for=/>object store</a>
failed due to quota reasons, {{QuotaExceededError}} MUST be used as
error.


The <dfn method for=IDBDatabase>deleteObjectStore(|name|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |database| be the <a>database</a> associated with this
    <a for=/>connection</a>.

2. Let |transaction| be the currently running <a>upgrade
    transaction</a> associated with |database|, or
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception if none.

3. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}} exception.

4. Let |store| be the <a for=/>object store</a> <a
    for=object-store>named</a> |name| in |database|,
    or <a>throw</a> a {{NotFoundError}} exception if none.

5. Remove |store| from this <a for=/>connection</a>'s <a>object
    store set</a>.

6. Destroy |store|.

This method destroys the <a for=/>object store</a> with the given name in
the <a>connected</a> <a>database</a>. Note that this
method must only be called from within an <a>upgrade transaction</a>.

This method synchronously modifies the
{{IDBDatabase/objectStoreNames}} property on the {{IDBDatabase}}
instance on which it was called.


The <dfn method for=IDBDatabase>transaction(|storeNames|, |mode|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. If |mode| parameter is not {{"readonly"}} or {{"readwrite"}},
    <a>throw</a> a <a>TypeError</a>.

2. If this method is called on {{IDBDatabase}} object for which an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is still running,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

3. If this method is called on an {{IDBDatabase}} instance where the <a>close pending flag</a> is set,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

4. Let |scope| be the set of unique strings in |storeNames| if it is a sequence,
    or a set containing one string equal to |storeNames| otherwise.

5. If any string in |scope| is not the name of an <a for=/>object store</a> in the <a>connected</a> <a>database</a>,
    <a>throw</a> a {{NotFoundError}} exception.

6. If |scope| is empty,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidAccessError}} exception.

7. Let |transaction| be a newly <a>created</a> <a for=/>transaction</a>
    with |connection|, |mode| and the set of <a for=/>object stores</a> named in |scope|.

8. When control is returned to the event loop, the implementation MUST unset the <a>active flag</a>.

    <aside class=issue>Specify this more precisely in terms of tasks and microtasks.</aside>

9. Return an {{IDBTransaction}} object representing |transaction|.

<aside class=note>
  The created |transaction| will follow the <a for=transaction>lifetime</a> rules.
</aside>


The <dfn method for=IDBDatabase>close()</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Run the <a>steps for closing a database connection</a> with this <a for=/>connection</a>.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBDatabase>onabort</dfn> attribute is the
event handler for the <code>abort</code> event.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBDatabase>onclose</dfn> attribute is the
event handler for the <code>close</code> event.

<aside class=note>&#9752; The {{IDBDatabase/onclose}} attribute is new in this edition. &#9752;</aside>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBDatabase>onerror</dfn> attribute is the

This method creates and returns a new <a for=/>index</a> with the given name
in the <a for=/>object store</a>. Note that this method must only be called
from within an <a>upgrade transaction</a>.

The index that is requested to be created can contain constraints on
the data allowed in the index's <a>referenced</a> object store, such
as requiring uniqueness of the values referenced by the index's
keyPath. If the <a>referenced</a> object store already contains data
which violates these constraints, this MUST NOT cause the
implementation of createIndex to throw an exception or affect what it
returns. The implementation MUST still create and return an
{{IDBIndex}} object, and the implementation MUST <a>queue a
task</a> to abort the <a>upgrade transaction</a> which was used for
the createIndex call.


This method synchronously modifies the {{IDBObjectStore/indexNames}}
property on the {{IDBObjectStore}} instance on which it was called.
Although this method does not return an {{IDBRequest}} object, the
index creation itself is processed as an asynchronous request within
the <a>upgrade transaction</a>.

In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to
asynchronously run into problems creating the index after the
createIndex method has returned. For example in implementations where
metadata about the newly created index is queued up to be inserted
into the database asynchronously, or where the implementation might
need to ask the user for permission for quota reasons. Such
implementations MUST still create and return an {{IDBIndex}}
object, and once the implementation determines that creating the index
has failed, it MUST abort the transaction using the <a>steps for
aborting a transaction</a> using an appropriate error as
|error|. For example if creating the <a for=/>index</a> failed due
to quota reasons, {{QuotaExceededError}} MUST be used as error and
if the index can't be created due to <a>unique flag</a> constraints,
{{ConstraintError}} MUST be used as error.

<aside class=example>

The asynchronous creation of indexes is observable in the following example:

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var request1 = objectStore.put({name: "betty"}, 1);
var request2 = objectStore.put({name: "betty"}, 2);
var index = objectStore.createIndex("by_name", "name", {unique: true});
</pre>

At the point where {{createIndex()}} called, neither of the
<a>requests</a> have executed. When the second request executes, a
duplicate name is created. Since the index creation is considered an
asynchronous <a>request</a>, the index's <a data-lt="unique
flag">uniqueness constraint</a> does not cause the second
<a>request</a> to fail. Instead, the <a for=/>transaction</a> will be <a>aborted</a> when the index is created and
the constraint fails.

4. If |transaction| has <a>finished</a>, <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}
    exception.

<aside class=note>

This method synchronously modifies the {{IDBObjectStore/indexNames}}

<aside class=note>&#9752; The {{IDBIndex/name}} attribute's setter is new in this edition. &#9752;</aside>


The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>objectStore</dfn> attribute's getter
must return this <a>index handle</a>'s <a for=index-handle>object
store handle</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>keyPath</dfn> attribute's getter must
return this <a>index handle</a>'s <a for=index-handle>index</a>'s <a
for=object-store>key path</a>.

The conversion is done following the normal [[!WEBIDL]] binding logic
for {{DOMString}} and <a>sequence&lt;DOMString&gt;</a> values, as
appropriate.

The returned value is not the same instance that was used when the
<a for=/>index</a> was created. However, if this attribute returns an object
(specifically an <a>Array</a>), it returns the same object instance
every time it is inspected. Changing the properties of the object has
no effect on the <a for=/>index</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>multiEntry</dfn> attribute's getter
must return true if this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
for=index-handle>index</a>'s <a>multiEntry flag</a> is set, and false
otherwise.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>unique</dfn> attribute's getter must
return true if this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
for=index-handle>index</a>'s <a>unique flag</a> is set, and false
otherwise.


The <dfn method for=IDBIndex>get(|query|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |transaction| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>transaction</a>.

2. Let |index| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>index</a>.

3. If |index| or |index|'s <a for=/>object store</a> has
    been deleted, <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

4. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}} exception.

5. Let |range| be the result of running the steps to
    <a>convert a value to a key range</a> with |query| and
    |null disallowed flag| set. Rethrow any exceptions.

6. Run the <a>steps for asynchronously executing a request</a> and
      return the {{IDBRequest}} created by these steps. The steps
      are run with this <a>index handle</a> as |source| and
      the <a>steps for retrieving a referenced value from an index</a>
      as |operation|, using |index| and
      |range|.

The |query| parameter may be a <a for=/>key</a> or an
{{IDBKeyRange}} identifying the <a>record</a> to be retrieved. If a
range is specified, the method retrieves the first existing record in
that range.


<aside class=note>
  This method produces the same result if a record with the given key
  doesn't exist as when a record exists, but has undefined as value.
  If you need to tell the two situations apart, you can use
  {{IDBIndex/openCursor()}} with the same key. This will return a cursor
  with undefined as value if a record exists, or no cursor if no such
  record exists.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=cursor-interface>The {{IDBCursor}} interface</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<a>Cursor</a> objects implement the {{IDBCursor}} interface. There
is only ever one {{IDBCursor}} instance representing a given
<a>cursor</a>. There is no limit on how many cursors can be used at
the same time.


<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBCursor {
  readonly attribute (IDBObjectStore or IDBIndex) source;
  readonly attribute IDBCursorDirection           direction;
  readonly attribute any                          key;
  readonly attribute any                          primaryKey;

  IDBRequest update(any value);
  IDBRequest delete();
};

enum IDBCursorDirection {
  "next",
  "nextunique",
  "prev",
  "prevunique"
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>source</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the <a for=cursor>source</a> of this <a>cursor</a>. This
attribute never returns null or throws an exception, even if the
cursor is currently being iterated, has iterated past its end, or its
<a for=/>transaction</a> is not <a>active</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>direction</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the <a>direction</a> of the <a>cursor</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>key</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the result of running the steps to <a>convert a key to a
value</a> with the cursor's current <a for=cursor>key</a>. Note that
if this property returns an object (e.g. a <a>Date</a> or
<a>Array</a>), it returns the same object instance every time it is
inspected, until the cursor's <a for=cursor>key</a> is changed. This
means that if the object is modified, those modifications will be seen
by anyone inspecting the value of the cursor. However modifying such
an object does not modify the contents of the database.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>primaryKey</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the result of running the steps to <a>convert a key to a
value</a> with the cursor's current <a>effective key</a>. Note that if
this property returns an object (e.g. a <a>Date</a> or <a>Array</a>),
it returns the same object instance every time it is inspected, until
the cursor's <a>effective key</a> is changed. This means that if the
object is modified, those modifications will be seen by anyone
inspecting the value of the cursor. However modifying such an object
does not modify the contents of the database.


The <dfn method for=IDBCursor>update(|value|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |transaction| be this <a>cursor</a>'s <a
    for=cursor>transaction</a>.

2. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}} exception.

3. If |transaction| is a <a>read-only transaction</a>,
    <a>throw</a> a {{ReadOnlyError}} exception.

4. If the cursor's <a for=cursor>source</a> or
    <a>effective object store</a> has been deleted, <a>throw</a> an
    {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

5. If this cursor's <a>got value flag</a> is unset, indicating that
    the cursor is being iterated or has iterated past its end,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

6. If this cursor's <a>key only flag</a> is set, <a>throw</a> an
    {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

7. Let |clone| be <a>structured clone</a> of |value|.
    Rethrow any exceptions.

8. If the <a>effective object store</a> of this cursor uses <a>in-line
    keys</a>, run these substeps:

    1. Let |kpk| be the result of running the steps to
        <a>extract a key from a value using a key path</a> with
        |clone| and the <a for=object-store>key
        path</a> of the <a>effective object store</a>.
        Rethrow any exceptions.

    2. If |kpk| is failure, invalid, or not <a>equal to</a>
        the cursor's <a>effective key</a>, <a>throw</a> a
        {{DataError}} exception.

9. Run <a>steps for asynchronously executing a request</a> and return
    the {{IDBRequest}} created by these steps. The steps are run
    with this <a>cursor</a> as |source| and the <a>steps for
    storing a record into an object store</a> as |operation|,
    using this cursor's <a>effective object store</a> as
    |store|, the |clone| as |value|, this
    cursor's <a>effective key</a> as |key|, and with the
    |no-overwrite flag| unset.


<aside class=note>
  A result of running the <a>steps for storing a record into an object
  store</a> is that if the record has been deleted since the cursor
  moved to it, a new record will be created.
</aside>


The <dfn method for=IDBCursor>advance(|count|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. If |count| is 0 (zero), <a>throw</a> a <a>TypeError</a>.

2. Let |transaction| be this <a>cursor</a>'s <a
    for=cursor>transaction</a>.

3. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}} exception.

4. If the cursor's <a for=cursor>source</a> or
    <a>effective object store</a> has been deleted, <a>throw</a> an
    {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

5. If this cursor's <a>got value flag</a> is unset, indicating that
    the cursor is being iterated or has iterated past its end,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

7. Unset the <a>got value flag</a> on the cursor.

8. Let |request| be the <a>request</a> created when this
    <a>cursor</a> was created.

9. Unset the <a>done flag</a> on |request|.

10. Run the <a>steps for asynchronously executing a request</a> with
    the cursor's <a for=cursor>source</a> as
    |source| and the <a>steps for iterating a cursor</a> with
    this <a>cursor</a> and |count|, and |request|.


<aside class=note>
  Calling this method more than once before new cursor data has been
  loaded - for example, calling {{advance()}} twice from the
  same onsuccess handler - results in an {{InvalidStateError}}
  exception being thrown on the second call because the cursor's
  <a>got value flag</a> has been unset.
</aside>


The <dfn method for=IDBCursor>continue(|key|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. Let |transaction| be this <a>cursor</a>'s <a
    for=cursor>transaction</a>.

2. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}} exception.

3. If the cursor's <a for=cursor>source</a> or
    <a>effective object store</a> has been deleted, <a>throw</a> an
    {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

4. If this cursor's <a>got value flag</a> is unset, indicating that
    the cursor is being iterated or has iterated past its end,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

5. If |key| is given, run these substeps:

    1. Let |r| be the result of running the steps to
        <a>convert a value to a key</a> with |key|.

A <a>cursor</a> that has the <a>key only flag</a> unset implements the
{{IDBCursorWithValue}} interface as well.


<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBCursorWithValue : IDBCursor {
  readonly attribute any value;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursorWithValue>value</dfn> attribute's
getter must return the cursor's current <a for=cursor>value</a>. Note
that if this property returns an object, it returns the same object
instance every time it is inspected, until the cursor's <a
for=cursor>value</a> is changed. This means that if the object is
modified, those modifications will be seen by anyone inspecting the
value of the cursor. However modifying such an object does not modify
the contents of the database.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=transaction>The {{IDBTransaction}} interface</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<a for=/>Transaction</a> objects implement the following interface:

<pre class=idl>

};

enum IDBTransactionMode {

</pre>

The {{IDBTransaction/objectStoreNames}} attribute's getter must run
the following steps:

1. If this <a for=/>transaction</a> is an <a>upgrade transaction</a>, return a
    <a>sorted list</a> of the <a for=object-store>names</a>
    of the <a for=/>object stores</a> in this <a for=/>transaction</a>'s
    <a for=/>connection</a>'s <a>object store set</a>.

2. Otherwise, return a <a>sorted list</a> of the <a for=object-store>names</a>
    of the <a for=/>object stores</a> in this <a for=/>transaction</a>'s <a>scope</a>.


<aside class=note>&#9752; The {{IDBTransaction/objectStoreNames}} attribute is new in this edition. &#9752;</aside>

<aside class=note>
  The contents of each list returned by this attribute does not
  change, but subsequent calls to this attribute during an <a>upgrade
  transaction</a> may return lists with different contents as
  <a for=/>object stores</a> are created and deleted.
</aside>

The {{IDBTransaction/mode}} attribute's getter must return the
<a>mode</a> of the <a for=/>transaction</a>.

The {{IDBTransaction/db}} attribute's getter must return the
<a>database</a> <a for=/>connection</a> of which this <a for=/>transaction</a> is
a part.

The {{IDBTransaction/error}} attribute's getter must return this
<a for=/>transaction</a>'s <a for=transaction>error</a>, or null
if none.

<aside class=note>
  If this <a for=/>transaction</a> was aborted due to a failed
  <a>request</a>, this will be the same as the <a>request</a>'s <a
  for=request>error</a>.

  If this <a for=/>transaction</a> was aborted due to an uncaught exception
  in an event handler, the error will be {{AbortError}}.

  If the <a for=/>transaction</a> was aborted due to an error while
  committing, it will reflect the reason for the failure (e.g.
  {{QuotaExceededError}}, {{ConstraintError}}, or
  {{UnknownError}}).
</aside>


The <dfn method for=IDBTransaction>objectStore(|name|)</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. If |transaction| has <a>finished</a>, <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}
    exception.

2. Let |store| be the <a for=/>object store</a> <a
    for=object-store>named</a> |name| in this
    <a for=/>transaction</a>'s <a>scope</a>, or <a>throw</a> a
    {{NotFoundError}} exception if none.

3. Return an <a for=/>object store handle</a> associated with
    |store| and this <a for=/>transaction</a>.

<aside class=note>
  Each call to this method on the same {{IDBTransaction}} instance
  with the same name returns the same {{IDBObjectStore}} instance.
</aside>

<aside class=note>
  The returned {{IDBObjectStore}} instance is specific to this
  {{IDBTransaction}}. If this method is called on a different
  {{IDBTransaction}}, a different {{IDBObjectStore}} instance is
  returned.

The <dfn method for=IDBTransaction>abort()</dfn> method, when invoked, must run these steps:

1. If this <a for=/>transaction</a> is <a>finished</a>,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} exception.

2. Unset the <a for=/>transaction</a>'s <a>active flag</a> and run the
    <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> with null as |error|.


The {{IDBTransaction/onabort}} attribute is the event handler for the
<code>abort</code> event.

The {{IDBTransaction/oncomplete}} attribute is the event handler for
the <code>complete</code> event.

The {{IDBTransaction/onerror}} attribute is the event handler for the
<code>error</code> event.

<aside class=note>
  To determine if a <a for=/>transaction</a> has completed successfully,
  listen to the <a for=/>transaction</a>'s <code>complete</code> event
  rather than the <code>success</code> event of a particular
  <a>request</a>, because the <a for=/>transaction</a> may still fail after
  the <code>success</code> event fires.

<h3 id=opening>Opening a database</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The <dfn>steps for opening a database</dfn> are defined in the following steps. The algorithm in these steps
takes four arguments:
the |origin| which requested the <a>database</a> to be opened,
a database |name|,
a database |version|,
and a |request|.


<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
Let |db| be the <a>database</a> <a for=database>named</a> |name| in the
origin |origin|, or null otherwise.

<li>
If |db| is not null, run these substeps:
<ol>
<li>Wait until the following conditions are all fulfilled:
<ul>
<li>
No already existing <a for=/>connections</a> to |db|, have
non-<a>finished</a> <a>upgrade transaction</a>.

<li>
If |db| has its <a>delete pending flag</a> set, wait until |db| has
been deleted.

</ul>
<aside class=note>
If several requests with the same |origin| and |name| are waiting due to the above conditions,
and those connections have a higher version than the database's current version, then once any of
those connections can proceed to the next step in this algorithm it will immediately start
an <a>upgrade transaction</a>. This prevents the other connections from proceeding until that
<a>upgrade transaction</a> is finished.
</aside>

<li>
If |db| was deleted, let |db| be null.

</ol>

<li>
If |version| is undefined,
let |version| be 1 if |db| is null, or |db|'s <a for=database>version</a> otherwise.

<li>
If |db| is null, let |db| be a new <a>database</a> with
<a for=database>name</a> |name|, <a for=database>version</a> 0 (zero) as <a for=database>version</a>,
and with no <a for=/>object stores</a>.

<li>
If |db|'s <a for=database>version</a> is greater than |version|, abort these steps and return
a new {{VersionError}}.

<li>
Let |connection| be a new <a for=/>connection</a> to |db|.

<li>
Set |connection|'s <a for=connection>version</a> to |version|.

<li>
If |db|'s <a for=database>version</a> is less than |version|, run these substeps:
<ol>
<li>
Run the <a>steps for running an upgrade transaction</a>
using |connection|, |version| and |request|.

<li>
If |connection| was <a for=connection>closed</a>,
create and return a new {{AbortError}} exception and abort these steps.

<li>
If the <a>upgrade transaction</a> was aborted,
run the <a>steps for closing a database connection</a> with |connection|,
create and return a new {{AbortError}} exception and abort these steps.

</ol>

<li>
Return |connection|.

</ol>



<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=closing-connection>Closing a database</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The <dfn>steps for closing a database connection</dfn> are as follows.
These steps take two arguments, a |connection| object, and an
optional |forced flag|.

<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
Set the <a>close pending flag</a> of |connection|.

<li>
If the |forced flag| is set, then for each |transaction| <a>created</a>
using |connection| run the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> with
|transaction| and newly created {{AbortError}} exception.

<li>
Wait for all transactions <a>created</a> using |connection| to complete.
Once they are complete, |connection| is <a for=connection>closed</a>.

<li>
If the |forced flag| is set, then fire a <code>close</code> event at
|connection|. The event MUST use the <a>Event</a> interface and have its
type set to "<code>close</code>". The event MUST NOT bubble or be cancelable.

<aside class=note>&#9752; This behavior is new in this edition. &#9752;</aside>

</ol>
<aside class=note>
Once the <a>close pending flag</a> has been set no new transactions can be
<a>created</a> using |connection|. All methods that
<a>create</a> transactions first check the <a>close pending flag</a> first and
throw an exception if it is set.
</aside>
<aside class=note>
Once the <a for=/>connection</a> is closed, this can unblock the <a>steps for running an upgrade
transaction</a>, and the <a>steps for deleting a database</a>, which <a href="#delete-close-block">both</a>
<a href="#version-change-close-block">wait</a> for <a for=/>connections</a> to a given <a>database</a> to be closed
before continuing.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=deleting-a-database>Deleting a database</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The <dfn>steps for deleting a database</dfn> are as follows.
The algorithm in these steps takes three arguments:
the |origin| that requested the <a>database</a> to be deleted,
a database |name|,
and a |request|.

<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
Let |db| be the <a>database</a> with the given name from the origin |origin|,
if one exists. Otherwise, return 0 (zero).

<li>
Set |db|'s <a>delete pending flag</a>.

<li>
Let |openConnections| be the set of all <a for=/>connections</a>
associated with |db|.

<li>
For each |entry| in |openConnections| that does not have its <a>close pending flag</a> set,
<a>fire a version change event</a> named <code>versionchange</code>
at |entry| with |db|'s <a for=database>version</a> and null.

<aside class=note>
  Firing this event might cause one or more of the other objects in
  |openConnections| to be closed, in which case the
  <code>versionchange</code> event MUST NOT be fired at those objects
  if that hasn't yet been done.
</aside>

<li>
If any of the <a for=/>connections</a> in |openConnections| are still not closed,
<a>fire a version change event</a> named <code>blocked</code>
at |request| with |db|'s <a for=database>version</a> and null.

<li id="delete-close-block">
Wait until all <a for=/>connections</a> in |openConnections| are <a for=connection>closed</a> and all of
their transactions are <a>finished</a>.

<li>
Return |version|.

</ol>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=commit-transaction>Steps for committing a transaction</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When taking the <dfn>steps for committing a transaction</dfn> the implementation MUST
execute the following algorithm. This algorithm takes one argument, the |transaction| to commit.

<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
All the changes made to the <a>database</a> by |transaction| are written to the <a>database</a>.

<li>
If an error occurs while writing the changes to the <a>database</a>, abort the transaction by following
the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> with |transaction|
and an appropriate for the error, for example {{QuotaExceededError}} or {{UnknownError}}.

<li>
<a>Queue a task</a> to dispatch an event at |transaction|.
The event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and have its {{Event/type}} set to "<code>complete</code>".
The event does not bubble and is not cancelable.

<aside class=note>
  Even if an exception is thrown from one of the event handlers of
  this event, the transaction is still committed since writing the
  database changes happens before the event takes places. Only after
  the transaction has been successfully written is the
  "<code>complete</code>" event fired.
</aside>

</ol>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=abort-transaction>Steps for aborting a transaction</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When taking the <dfn>steps for aborting a transaction</dfn> the implementation MUST
execute the following algorithm. This algorithm takes two arguments:
the |transaction| to abort,
and |error|.

<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
All the changes made to the <a>database</a> by the
<a for=/>transaction</a> are reverted.

For <a>upgrade transactions</a> this includes changes to
the set of <a for=/>object stores</a> and <a for=/>indexes</a>,
as well as the change to the <a for=database>version</a>. Any
<a for=/>object stores</a> and <a for=/>indexes</a> which were
created during the transaction are now considered
deleted for the purposes of other algorithms.

<li>
If |transaction| is an <a>upgrade transactions</a>,
run the  <a>steps for aborting an upgrade transaction</a>
with |transaction|. This reverts changes to all
<a for=/>connection</a>,
<a for=/>object store handle</a>, and
<a>index handle</a>
instances associated with |transaction|.

<li>
If |error| is not null, set |transaction|'s <a for=transaction>error</a>
to |error|.

<li>
For each |request| in |transaction|'s <a>request list</a>
with <a>done flag</a> unset,
abort the <a>steps for asynchronously executing a request</a> for |request| and
<a>queue a task</a> to run these substeps:
<ol>
<li>Set the <a>done flag</a> on |request|.
<li>Set the <a for=request>result</a> of |request| to undefined.
<li>Set the <a for=request>error</a> of |request| to a newly created {{AbortError}} exception.
<li>
Dispatch an event at |request|. The event must use
the <a>Event</a> interface and have its {{Event/type}} set to "<code>error</code>".
The event bubbles and is cancelable.

</ol>

<aside class=note>
  This does not always result in any <code>error</code> events being
  fired. For example if a transaction is aborted due to an error while
  <a for=transaction>committing</a> the transaction, or if it was the
  last remaining request that failed.
</aside>

<li>
<a>Queue a task</a> to dispatch an event at |transaction|.
The event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and have its {{Event/type}} set to "<code>abort</code>".

<h3 id=async-execute-request>Steps for asynchronously executing a <a>request</a></h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When taking the <dfn>steps for asynchronously executing a request</dfn> the implementation MUST run the
following algorithm. The algorithm takes a |source| object and an |operation| to
perform on a database, and an optional |request|.


These steps can be aborted at any point if the <a for=/>transaction</a> the created <a>request</a> belongs
to is <a>aborted</a> using the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a>

<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
Let |transaction| be the <a for=/>transaction</a> associated with |source|.

<li>
If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>
throw a {{TransactionInactiveError}} exception.

<li>
If |request| was not given, let |request| be a new |request| with
<a for=request>source</a> as |source|

<li>
Add |request| to the end of |transaction|'s <a>request list</a>.

<li>
Return |request| and queue up the execution of the remaining steps in this algorithm.

<li>
Wait until all previously added <a>requests</a> in |transaction| have their
<a>done flag</a> set.

<li>
Let |result| be the result of performing |operation|.

<li>
If |result| is an error, then revert all changes made by |operation|,
set the <a>done flag</a> on |request|,
set <a for=request>result</a> of |request|
to undefined and set the <a for=request>error</a> on |request|
to |result|.
Finally <a>fire an error event</a> at |request|.

<aside class=note>
  This only reverts the changes done by this request, not any other
  changes made by the transaction.
</aside>

<li>
Otherwise, set the <a>done flag</a>
on the |request|, set <a for=request>result</a> of |request|
to |result| set the <a for=request>error</a> of |request| to undefined.
Finally <a>fire a success event</a> at |request|.

The <dfn>steps for running an upgrade transaction</dfn> are

The <dfn>steps for aborting an upgrade transaction</dfn> |transaction| are as follows.

<aside class=note>
  The steps are run after the normal <a>steps for aborting a
  transaction</a>, which revert changes to the <a>database</a>
  including the set of associated <a for=/>object stores</a> and <a
  for=/>indexes</a>, as well as the change to the <a
  for=database>version</a>.
</aside>

<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
Let |connection| be |transaction|'s <a for=/>connection</a>.

<li>
Let |database| be |connection|'s <a>database</a>.

<li>
Set |connection|'s <a for=connection>version</a> to |database|'s <a for=database>version</a>
if |database| previously existed,
or 0 (zero) if |database| was newly created

<aside class=note>
  This reverts the value of {{IDBDatabase/version}} returned by the
  {{IDBDatabase}} object.
</aside>

<li>
Set |connection|'s <a>object store set</a> to the
set of <a for=/>object stores</a> in |database|
if |database| previously existed,
or the empty set if |database| was newly created.

<aside class=note>
  This reverts the value of {{IDBDatabase/objectStoreNames}} returned
  by the {{IDBDatabase}} object.
</aside>

<li>
For each <a for=/>object store handle</a> |handle| associated with |transaction|,
including those for <a for=/>object stores</a>
that were deleted during |transaction|, run these substeps:
<ol>
<li>
Set |handle|'s <a for=object-store-handle>name</a> to
its <a for=object-store-handle>object store</a>'s <a for=object-store>name</a>.

<li>
Set |handle|'s <a>index set</a> to the
set of <a for=/>indexes</a> that reference its <a for=object-store-handle>object store</a>.

</ol>

<aside class=note>
  This reverts the values of {{IDBObjectStore/name}} and
  {{IDBObjectStore/indexNames}} returned by related {{IDBObjectStore}}
  objects.

  Although script cannot access an <a for=/>object store</a> by using
  the {{objectStore()}} method on an {{IDBTransaction}} instance after
  the <a for=/>transaction</a> is aborted, it may still have
  references to {{IDBObjectStore}} instances where the
  {{IDBObjectStore/name}} and {{IDBObjectStore/indexNames}} properties
  can be queried.

<h3 id=fire-success-event>Fire a success event</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

To <dfn>fire a success event</dfn> at a <a>request</a>,
the implementation MUST run the following steps:

<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
Set |transaction| to the <a for=/>transaction</a> associated with the <a for=request>source</a>.

<li>
Set the <a>active flag</a> of |transaction|.

<li>
Dispatch an event at <a>request</a>. The event must use
the <a>Event</a> interface and have its {{Event/type}} set to "<code>success</code>".
The event does not bubble and is not cancelable.

<li>
Unset the <a>active flag</a> of |transaction|.

<li>
If an exception was propagated out from any event handler while dispatching the event in step 3,
abort the transaction by following the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> with
|transaction| and a newly created {{AbortError}} exception.

</ol>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=fire-error-event>Fire an error event</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

To <dfn>fire an error event</dfn> at a <a>|request|</a>,
the implementation MUST run the following steps:

<ol class=algorithm>
<li>
Set |transaction| to the <a for=/>transaction</a> associated with the <a for=request>source</a>.

<li>
Set the <a>active flag</a> of |transaction|.

<li>
Dispatch an event at |request|. The event must use
the <a>Event</a> interface and have its {{Event/type}} set to "<code>error</code>".
The event bubbles and is cancelable.

<li>
Unset the <a>active flag</a> of |transaction|.

<li>
If an exception was propagated out from any event handler while dispatching the event in step 3,
abort the transaction by following the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> with
|transaction| and a newly created {{AbortError}} exception and terminate these steps.
This is done even if the event's <a>canceled flag</a> is not set.

<aside class=note>
  This means that if an error event is fired and any of the event
  handlers throw an exception, |transaction|'s
  {{IDBTransaction/error}} property is set to an {{AbortError}}
  exception rather than |request|'s <a for=request>error</a>,
  even if {{Event/preventDefault()}} is never called.
</aside>

<li>
If the event's <a>canceled flag</a> is not set,
run the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a>
using |transaction| and <a>request</a>'s <a for=request>error</a>.

<li>
If the <a>key generator</a>'s <a>current number</a> is greater than 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992),
then this operation failed with a {{ConstraintError}}. Abort this algorithm without taking
any further steps.

<li>Set |key| to the <a>key generator</a>'s <a>current number</a>
<li>Increase the <a>key generator</a>'s <a>current number</a> by 1.
<li>
If |store| also uses <a>in-line keys</a>, then run the steps to

|key| and |store|'s <a for=object-store>key path</a>.

</ol>

<li>
Otherwise, if the <a for=key>type</a> of |key| is <i>number</i>
and the <a for=key>value</a> is greater than or equal to the <a>key generator</a>'s

If a <a>record</a> already exists in |store| with its key <a>equal to</a> |key|, then
remove the <a>record</a> from |store| using the <a>steps for deleting records from an object store</a>.

failed with a {{ConstraintError}}. Abort this algorithm without taking any further steps.

<li>
If |index|'s <a>multiEntry flag</a> is unset, or if |index key| is not an <a>array key</a>
then store a record in |index| containing |index key| as its key and |key| as its
value. The record is stored in |index|'s <a for=index>list of records</a> such
that the list is sorted primarily on the records keys, and secondarily on the records values, in ascending

<li>
If |index|'s <a>multiEntry flag</a> is set and |index key| is an <a>array key</a>,

<aside class=note>
  These steps are similar to those to <a>convert a value to a key</a>

<h2 id=privacy>Privacy</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3 id=user-tracking>User tracking</h3>

A third-party host (or any object capable of getting content
distributed to multiple sites) could use a unique identifier stored in
its client-side database to track a user across multiple sessions,
building a profile of the user's activities. In conjunction with a
site that is aware of the user's real id object (for example an
e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials), this could
allow oppressive groups to target individuals with greater accuracy
than in a world with purely anonymous Web usage.

There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk
of user tracking:


<dl>
<dt>Blocking third-party storage</dt>
<dd>
User agents MAY restrict access to the database objects
to scripts originating at the domain of the top-level document of
the <span>browsing context</span>, for instance denying access to
the API for pages from other domains running in <code>iframe</code>s.
</dd>

<dt>Expiring stored data</dt>
<dd>

User agents MAY automatically delete stored data after a period
of time.

This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the
site would then only be able to track the user across multiple
sessions when she authenticates with the site itself (e.g. by
making a purchase or logging in to a service).


However, this also puts the user's data at risk.
</dd>

<dt>Treating persistent storage as cookies</dt>
<dd>

User agents should present the database feature
to the user in a way that associates them strongly with HTTP
session cookies. [[COOKIES]]

This might encourage users to view such storage with healthy
suspicion.

</dd>

<dt>Site-specific white-listing of access to databases</dt>
<dd>

User agents MAY require the user to authorize access to
databases before a site can use the feature.

</dd>

<dt>Origin-tracking of stored data</dt>
<dd>

User agents MAY record the <a>origins</a>
of sites that contained content from third-party origins that
caused data to be stored.

If this information is then used to present the view of data
currently in persistent storage, it would allow the user to make
informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage to
prune. Combined with a blacklist ("delete this data and prevent
this domain from ever storing data again"), the user can restrict
the use of persistent storage to sites that she trusts.

</dd>

<dt>Shared blacklists</dt>
<dd>

User agents MAY allow users to share their persistent storage
domain blacklists.

This would allow communities to act together to protect their
privacy.

</dd>
</dl>

While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this API for user
tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single domain, a
site can continue to track the user during a session, and can then
pass all this information to the third party along with any
identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses)
obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple
sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be
created.

However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no
cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using
session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used for
innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even
retroactively). This information can then be shared with other
sites, using using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific
data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine
separate sessions into coherent user profiles.

<h3 id=cookie-resurrection>Cookie resurrection</h3>

If the user interface for persistent storage presents data in the
persistent storage features described in this specification
separately from data in HTTP session cookies, then users are likely
to delete data in one and not the other. This would allow sites to
use the two features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a
user's attempts to protect his privacy.


<h3 id=sensitivity-of-data>Sensitivity of data</h3>

User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially
sensitive; it is quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments,
health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this
mechanism.

To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data,
it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2 id=authorization>Authorization</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<h3 id=dns-spoofing-attacks>DNS spoofing attacks</h3>

Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot
guarantee that a host claiming to be in a certain domain really is
from that domain. To mitigate this, pages can use SSL. Pages using
SSL can be sure that only pages using SSL that have certificates
identifying them as being from the same domain can access their
databases.


<h3 id=cross-directory-attacks>Cross-directory attacks</h3>

Different authors sharing one host name, for example users
hosting content on <code>geocities.com</code>, all share one
set of databases.

There is no feature to restrict the access by pathname. Authors on
shared hosts are therefore recommended to avoid using these
features, as it would be trivial for other authors to read the data
and overwrite it.

<aside class=note>
  Even if a path-restriction feature was made available, the usual DOM
  scripting security model would make it trivial to bypass this
  protection and access the data from any path.
</aside>

<h3 id=implementation-risks>Implementation risks</h3>

The two primary risks when implementing these persistent storage
features are letting hostile sites read information from other
domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is then
read from other domains.

Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be
read from their domain causes <em>information leakage</em>, For
example, a user's shopping wish list on one domain could be used by
another domain for targeted advertising; or a user's
work-in-progress confidential documents stored by a word-processing
site could be examined by the site of a competing company.

Letting third-party sites write data to the persistent storage of
other domains can result in <em>information spoofing</em>, which is
equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add records to a
user's wish list; or a hostile site could set a user's session
identifier to a known ID that the hostile site can then use to track
the user's actions on the victim site.

Thus, strictly following the <span>origin</span> model described
in this specification is important for user security.
